                        one of the members of the Software Subteam, entering with high hopes of learning more about
                        control loops and creating simple AI
                        algorithms, as well as communication between different platforms. In other words, she wanted to
                        learn pretty much everything that involved staring at a computer screen. Strange girl. She
                        worked
                        mostly on making sure the turtle didn’t try to hard to run into a wall or hide in a dark corner
                        somewhere.

            <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/ZarinPic2.jpg" alt="" class="person-photo"/></span>Zarin is a
                third-year student at
                Olin studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. She is originally from New York City and loves
                animals, traveling, and boxing.
                She's very adventurous and loves to meet new people, see new places, and try new cuisines. She's also
                unbeatable at Guitar Hero drums. She was the other member of the Software Subteam. Her goals for this
                project included learning more about sensors
                and control and becoming more familiar with the process of iterative design. She was also in charge of
                making this website.</p>

            <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/LaurenPic.jpg" alt="" class="person-photo"/></span>Lauren is a
                second-year student
                at Olin College of Engineering, studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. She was the Electrical
                Subteam, with a goal of learning more about sensing. She wanted experience with selecting, calibrating,
                and implementing sensors that will contribute to the robot being aware of its state and surroundings.
                She was excited to even implement things such as operational amplifiers and multiplexers.
                This allowed her to apply knowledge from prior classes and improve the functionality of the circuit.</p>

                second year student at
                Olin College concentrating in Robotics. She was part of the Mechanical Subteam, and was involved in
                designing and fabricating the turtle. Katya’s goal was to create a beautiful robot turtle, and use this
                as incentive to learn about different fabrication methods and how to design for them.</p>

                second-year student at Olin College of Engineering Majoring in Robotics Engineering. Although his
                primary background is on the software side, he wanted to develop more skills in the mechanics side of
                Robotics, which he worked on for the majority of the project. His primary learning goal was
                rapid-iterative mechanical prototyping.</p>
