					<h2 align="left">Kaitlyn Keil </h2>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/KaitlynPic.jpg" alt="" /></span>Kaitlyn is a second-year student at Olin College, studying Engineering with Computing. She was one of the members of the Software Subteam, entering with high hopes of learning more about control loops and creating simple AI algorithms, as well as communication between different platforms. In other words, she wanted to learn pretty much everything that involved staring at a computer screen. Strange girl. She worked mostly on making sure the turtle didn’t try to hard to run into a wall or hide in a dark corner somewhere.</p>

					<h2>Zarin Bhuiyan </h2>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/ZarinPic2.jpg" alt="" /></span>Zarin is a third-year student at Olin studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. She is originally from New York City and loves animals, traveling, and boxing.
					She's very adventurous and loves to meet new people, see new places, and try new cuisines. She's also unbeatable at Guitar Hero drums. She was the other member of the Software Subteam. Her goals for this project included learning more about sensors
					and control and becoming more familiar with the process of iterative design. She was also in charge of making this website.</p>

					<h2>Lauren Pudvan </h2>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/LaurenPic.jpg" alt="" /></span>Lauren is a second-year student at Olin College of Engineering, studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. She was the Electrical Subteam, with a goal of learning more about sensing. She wanted experience with selecting, calibrating, and implementing sensors that will contribute to the robot being aware of its state and surroundings. She was excited to even implement things such as operational amplifiers and multiplexers.
						 This allowed her to apply knowledge from prior classes and improve the functionality of the circuit.</p>

					<h2>Katya Soltan</h2>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/KatyaPic.jpg" alt="" /></span>Katya is a second year student at Olin College concentrating in Robotics. She was part of the Mechanical Subteam, and was involved in designing and fabricating the turtle. Katya’s goal was to create a beautiful robot turtle, and use this as incentive to learn about different fabrication methods and how to design for them.</p>
