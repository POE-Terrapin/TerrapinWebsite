        <p>For this project it is important that the robot can sense its environment to assist in plant care. To do this
            many sensors were used. We are using an Arduino to power and control the majority of the circuit. The
            temperature component of a temperature and humidity sensor is utilized to make sure the plants are not
            getting too hot. There is a soil moisture sensor so it knows if the plant’s soil is too dry and needs to be
            watered. We have photoresistors to sense the light the plants are getting so they can receive the proper
            amount of sunlight. We included IR sensors so the robot can be aware of its surroundings and not collide
            with other objects. There are buttons on the bottom of the feet to sense if the foot is making contact with
            the ground. There is a 3 axis accelerometer to make tell if the robot is flipped over. There is also a
            switch in digital in/out pin 5 to allow us a method of lowering our power consumption by turning off certain
            components.</p>

        <p>These sensors are all powered at 5V and grounded using the power and ground from the arduino. The humidity,
            temperature, soil moisture, and IR sensors have a signal wire that goes to a port on the multiplexer. The
            photoresistors are wired in series with another resistor (330 Ohm) and the voltage is taken between these
            two resistors to know if the plants are receiving sunlight or ambient light. This reading also goes into
            pins on the multiplexer. </p>

        <p>We have 2 RGB LEDs as eyes. These are wired in parallel with each other so both eyes will always be the same
            color. The greens are getting power from the arduino's digital in/out pin 12, have a 1K Ohm resistor in
            series with them, and are grounded to thee arduino. The red and blue are set up similarly but with pin 7 and
            11 respectively. </p>

        <p>The servos are used to turn the turtle’s legs. These are also powered and grounded from the arduino with 5V.
            The signal for these come from digital pins 6 and 10 because they are capable of outputting PWM. The motors
            are getting powered and controlled by the motor controller.</p>

        <p>Lastly, A Raspberry Pi is being used so data from the robot can be displayed on a website and allow users to
            view the state of the robot.</p>
