            <p>This first sprint was focused on making the bare bones of a first-pass model, and we decided that the heart
                of our system was a turtle that wanted to stay in the light. Because of this, we turned our efforts towards
                making sure our turtle could reliably sense a change in the light above it and respond. In order to do this,
                we created a basic control loop that looked at the value of two photodiodes and compared the analog voltage
                input to a set value. If the photodiodes reported too low, the turtle would move away from that sensor,
                either rolling forward or backwards. The eyes also switched on or off in response to the motion. Due to this
                fairly arbitrarily chosen value, the sensor needed to be thoroughly covered, such as by a hand, before it
                began to move, and then moved only until the sensor was fully in light. If both sensors were covered, the
                turtle remained still, mimicking
                what our final product might do if needing to cool down. It also only moved along a single axis, and was
                completely unaware of any surroundings forward or back.</p>

            <p>We started off making a prototype of our design. This prototype utilized photodiodes, motors, and
                LEDs. The photodiodes were used to sense the light and allowed the robot to move away from shadows.
                To amplify the signal from the photodiodes we utilized op amps. This gave us a significant
                difference in the output voltage from shadows and light. The motors moved wheels so our prototype
                can move around. The LEDs showed which direction the robot was moving. This was to test a method of
                communicating our robot's state with a viewer. In this case the state was moving forward or
                backward.</p>

                <p>Our objective for the first sprint was to create a proof of concept for our project that encapsulated the
                    most basic behavior of the turtle,
                    responding to light. We built a two dimensional cardboard sketch model that would support the few necessary
                    components of such a system: wheels,
                    light sensors, LEDS, and an Arduino. Because the mechanical system for this sprint was meant to be a
                    platform for the electrical and software systems to test on,
                    we chose to create a very fast prototype to get an initial tangible image of what our project could be.
                    Thick cardboard was cut into a base plate the approximate size
                    and shape of what we imagined the final project to be. Wheels were made from the same cardboard, with their
                    edges covered in tape to make a smoother surface.
                    Rectangular cutouts for the wheels were made in the base plate, taking into account the wobbling of the
                    wheel due to its insecure connection to the wheel via hot glue.
                    Holes for the sensors and LEDs were simply poked through the base plate. The video of the working prototype can be found <a href = "https://vimeo.com/188361213"> here</a>.</p>

            <p>Starting the second sprint, we started on basic obstacle avoidance. Afterall, a turtle that runs into every
                wall it can when trying to escape the dark wouldn’t really work. However, we quickly ran into issues with
                finding analog pins that could be used to read the sensors and were not already assigned to another task on
                the motor shield. We started by using only two IR sensors in combination with the photodiodes, which was
                just few enough sensors to fit. Using these sensors, we took the code through a basic decision algorithm,
                where ‘seeing something’ meant that the IR sensor returned a voltage above a set value. We also normalized
                the IR values, so that the numbers were smaller. To be frank, this was rather pointless, but it was there
                nonetheless.</p>

            <p>The decision algorithm was as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>If shade in front, move backwards</li>
                <li>If shade over back sensor, check forward IR</li>
                <ul>
                    <li type="circle">If nothing in front, go forward</li>
                    <li type="circle">If something in front, check right IR</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li type="i">If nothing to right, turn right</li>
                        <li type="i">If something to right, turn left</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <div>
                <p class="button collapsor">CODE SNIPPET: Checking IRs for which direction is acceptable. Contains the later discarded

            </div>

            <p>We didn’t quite manage to combine this algorithm with the movement of the legs that the mechanical team made,
                although control code to move the servo-based legs was written. Instead, this time was spent struggling with
                the pins on the motor shield. Due to the difficulties there, we switched to using a multiplexer to cycle
                through sensors, and wrote basic code to switch between which pins on the multiplexer were being read.</p>

            </div>

            <p>We then included IR sensors to check forward and to the right whenever the turtle has to move</p>

            <p>Mechanical subteam wrote up control code for leg movemen; integration from wheel to leg is not yet
                completed.</p>

            <p>At the beginning of this sprint we planned out the additional sensors we would need and realized that
                we were going to need more Analog pins on the arduino. To remedy this we utilized a 8-to-1
                multiplexer 4051. This uses the arduino digital pins 3, 4, and 5 to select which of the 8 outputs on
                the multiplexer to send to analog pin 0.</p>

            <p>Another goal for this sprint was obstacle avoidance. Therefore we needed to be able to sense
                obstacles. For this we added 3 IR sensors. One went on the head pointing forward and the other two
                were on the sides.</p>

            <p>We ran into problems with finding analog pins that could be used to read the sensors and were not
                already assigned to another task on the motor shield. Once we realized this problem it was an easy
                fix to avoid using those analog pins for sensors.</p>

                <p>Our next step in Sprint 2 was to develop quadrupedal motion mimicking that of a turtle for our robot.
                    We referenced the movements of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dHtW0immKg">Allbot VR408 Robot
                        System</a>, a small spider-looking robot with two degrees of freedom in each leg provided by servos.
                </p>

                <p>Before we began designing the legs, we learned more about servos and the kind of load they can support. We
                    drew a very simple free body diagram of the connection between the body and a leg of the turtle when the leg
                    is on the ground:</p>

                <p>We ran into problems with finding analog pins that could be used to read the sensors and were not

            <p>This sprint was broken into pieces by Thanksgiving break. During the first part, we integrated the movement
                code from the previous sprint with the decision algorithm, as well as wrote code to allow for easy testing
                of sensors. After the break was done, we made a quick pivot from a purely Arduino based system to
                communication between a Raspberry Pi and the Arduino. This was in order to facilitate future development,
                such as a more intelligent decision algorithm and incorporate web-streaming of the data.</p>

            <p>One of the other main changes was switching from only moving when one of the sensors registered shade to
                constant motion, and both the photodiodes and the IR sensors became self-calibrating, which meant we had to
                assume the turtle was started up in ideal circumstances for that initial read. Data was logged to a CSV, and
                the turtle no longer moved backwards, due to realism and the linkages of the legs.</p>

            <p>Code for a temperature sensor and a soil moisture sensor were also added, with a ‘seeking shade’ setting that
                looks for shade to rest in, but these were not tied to actual sensors.</p>

            </header>

            <p>We purchased additional sensors and calibrated them for plant care!</p>

            <p>The photoresistors were calibrated as a new way to sense light that would use less space on the
                breadboard. This allowed for us to measure light from taking the voltage between the photoresistor
                and a 330 Ohm resistor. </p>

            <p>We added and calibrated a soil moisture sensor by putting it in different wet paper towels. Luckily
                this gave us a good range of data points so no amplification was necessary.</p>

            <p>We added and calibrated a temperature and humidity sensor. For the sake of this project being indoors
                the humidity sensor is not nearly as important when compared to the temperature because we do not
                plan for it to rain inside. The temperature sensor will make sure the plants do not overheat from
                the sunlight. If it is too hot, the turtle can move into the shade until it cools down. Calibrating
                this sensor was difficult because there is one output pin for both pieces of data. After a bunch of
                research we found an example code for this sensor and this worked to properly display our sensor
                values.</p>

            <p>This sprint was largely focused on making the mechanical and aesthetic sides of the turtle the best they
                could be. Due to this, there was little change in the software. One decision was that the turtle would
                self-calibrate its sensors, assuming that it started in ideal conditions. We also added RGB LED control for
                the eyes, so that we could be alerted if the moisture in the soil got too low.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Decided turtle would calibrate by starting in desired conditions and taking readings from sensors</li>
                <li>Added RGB LED control</li>

            <p>The goal this sprint was to clean up the circuit and decrease the volume taken up by the electronics, so that it could fit inside the electronics bay in the turtle’s ‘stomach’. To do this, we downsized to a smaller breadboard and later a protoboard. All wires were cut to length, both decreasing the space needed and cleaning up the circuit.</p>
            <p>In addition to this, we added buttons to the feet, an on/off switch, a raspberry pi, and an accelerometer. The buttons complete a circuit when depressed, providing the Arduino pin with 5 volts, and break the circuit when released. This allowed us to sense when a foot was on the ground, helping us control the gait of the turtle. The accelerometer was added for later data-streaming value. </p>
