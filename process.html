            <p>This first sprint was focused on making the bare bones of a first-pass model, and we decided that the
                heart
                of our system was a turtle that wanted to stay in the light. Because of this, we turned our efforts
                towards
                making sure our turtle could reliably sense a change in the light above it and respond. In order to do
                this,
                we created a basic control loop that looked at the value of two photodiodes and compared the analog
                voltage
                input to a set value. If the photodiodes reported too low, the turtle would move away from that sensor,
                either rolling forward or backwards. The eyes also switched on or off in response to the motion. Due to
                this
                fairly arbitrarily chosen value, the sensor needed to be thoroughly covered, such as by a hand, before
                it
                began to move, and then moved only until the sensor was fully in light. If both sensors were covered,
                the
                turtle remained still, mimicking
                what our final product might do if needing to cool down. It also only moved along a single axis, and was
                completely unaware of any surroundings forward or back.</p>

            <p>We started off making a prototype of our design. This prototype utilized photodiodes, motors, and
                LEDs. The photodiodes were used to sense the light and allowed the robot to move away from shadows.
                To amplify the signal from the photodiodes we utilized op amps. This gave us a significant
                difference in the output voltage from shadows and light. The motors moved wheels so our prototype
                can move around. The LEDs showed which direction the robot was moving. This was to test a method of
                communicating our robot's state with a viewer. In this case the state was moving forward or
                backward.</p>

                <p>Our objective for the first sprint was to create a proof of concept for our project that encapsulated
                    the
                    most basic behavior of the turtle,
                    responding to light. We built a two dimensional cardboard sketch model that would support the few
                    necessary
                    components of such a system: wheels,
                    light sensors, LEDS, and an Arduino. Because the mechanical system for this sprint was meant to be a
                    platform for the electrical and software systems to test on,
                    we chose to create a very fast prototype to get an initial tangible image of what our project could
                    be.
                    Thick cardboard was cut into a base plate the approximate size
                    and shape of what we imagined the final project to be. Wheels were made from the same cardboard,
                    with their
                    edges covered in tape to make a smoother surface.
                    Rectangular cutouts for the wheels were made in the base plate, taking into account the wobbling of
                    the
                    wheel due to its insecure connection to the wheel via hot glue.
                    Holes for the sensors and LEDs were simply poked through the base plate.

            <p>Starting the second sprint, we started on basic obstacle avoidance. Afterall, a turtle that runs into
                every
                wall it can when trying to escape the dark wouldn’t really work. However, we quickly ran into issues
                with
                finding analog pins that could be used to read the sensors and were not already assigned to another task
                on
                the motor shield. We started by using only two IR sensors in combination with the photodiodes, which was
                just few enough sensors to fit. Using these sensors, we took the code through a basic decision
                algorithm,
                where ‘seeing something’ meant that the IR sensor returned a voltage above a set value. We also
                normalized
                the IR values, so that the numbers were smaller. To be frank, this was rather pointless, but it was
                there
                nonetheless.</p>

            <p>The decision algorithm was as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>If shade in front, move backwards</li>
                <li>If shade over back sensor, check forward IR</li>
                <ul>
                    <li type="circle">If nothing in front, go forward</li>
                    <li type="circle">If something in front, check right IR</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li type="i">If nothing to right, turn right</li>
                        <li type="i">If something to right, turn left</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <div>
                <p class="process button collapsor">CODE SNIPPET: Checking IRs for which direction is acceptable.

            </div>

            <p>We didn’t quite manage to combine this algorithm with the movement of the legs that the mechanical team
                made,
                although control code to move the servo-based legs was written. Instead, this time was spent struggling
                with
                the pins on the motor shield. Due to the difficulties there, we switched to using a multiplexer to cycle
                through sensors, and wrote basic code to switch between which pins on the multiplexer were being
                read.</p>

            <p>We then included IR sensors to check forward and to the right whenever the turtle has to move</p>

            <p>Mechanical subteam wrote up control code for leg movemen; integration from wheel to leg is not yet
                completed.</p>

                </header>

                <p>At the beginning of this sprint we planned out the additional sensors we would need and realized that
                    we were going to need more Analog pins on the arduino. To remedy this we utilized a 8-to-1
                    multiplexer 4051. This uses the arduino digital pins 3, 4, and 5 to select which of the 8 outputs on
                    the multiplexer to send to analog pin 0.</p>

                <p>Another goal for this sprint was obstacle avoidance. Therefore we needed to be able to sense
                    obstacles. For this we added 3 IR sensors. One went on the head pointing forward and the other two
                    were on the sides.</p>

                <p>We ran into problems with finding analog pins that could be used to read the sensors and were not
                    already assigned to another task on the motor shield. Once we realized this problem it was an easy
                    fix to avoid using those analog pins for sensors.</p>

                    <p>Our next step in Sprint 2 was to develop quadrupedal motion mimicking that of a turtle for our

                        We referenced the movements of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dHtW0immKg">Allbot

                    <p>Before we began designing the legs, we learned more about servos and the kind of load they can
                        support. We
                        drew a very simple free body diagram of the connection between the body and a leg of the turtle
                        when the leg
                        is on the ground:</p>

                    <p>We ran into problems with finding analog pins that could be used to read the sensors and were not
                        already assigned to another task on the motor shield. Once we realized this problem it was an
                        easy
                        fix to avoid using those analog pins for sensors.</p>

            <p>This sprint was broken into pieces by Thanksgiving break. During the first part, we integrated the
                movement
                code from the previous sprint with the decision algorithm, as well as wrote code to allow for easy
                testing
                of sensors. After the break was done, we made a quick pivot from a purely Arduino based system to
                communication between a Raspberry Pi and the Arduino. This was in order to facilitate future
                development,
                such as a more intelligent decision algorithm and incorporate web-streaming of the data.</p>

            <p>One of the other main changes was switching from only moving when one of the sensors registered shade to
                constant motion, and both the photodiodes and the IR sensors became self-calibrating, which meant we had
                to
                assume the turtle was started up in ideal circumstances for that initial read. Data was logged to a CSV,
                and
                the turtle no longer moved backwards, due to realism and the linkages of the legs.</p>

            <p>Code for a temperature sensor and a soil moisture sensor were also added, with a ‘seeking shade’ setting
                that
                looks for shade to rest in, but these were not tied to actual sensors.</p>

            <p>We purchased additional sensors and calibrated them for plant care!</p>

            <p>The photoresistors were calibrated as a new way to sense light that would use less space on the
                breadboard. This allowed for us to measure light from taking the voltage between the photoresistor
                and a 330 Ohm resistor. </p>

            <p>We added and calibrated a soil moisture sensor by putting it in different wet paper towels. Luckily
                this gave us a good range of data points so no amplification was necessary.</p>

            <p>We added and calibrated a temperature and humidity sensor. For the sake of this project being indoors
                the humidity sensor is not nearly as important when compared to the temperature because we do not
                plan for it to rain inside. The temperature sensor will make sure the plants do not overheat from
                the sunlight. If it is too hot, the turtle can move into the shade until it cools down. Calibrating
                this sensor was difficult because there is one output pin for both pieces of data. After a bunch of
                research we found an example code for this sensor and this worked to properly display our sensor
                values.</p>

                <p>Sprint 3 was focused on continuing the development of quadrupedal motion. From the leg prototype of
                    Sprint 2, we realized that we needed three degrees of freedom to create a convincing turtle
                    movement. The leg was tilting up and down and panning side to side, but for the two motions to be
                    constructive, the leg needed to give under the turtle, or have a rolling motion. One of the options
                    was to add a third servo to provide this degree of freedom. Instead, we decided to create a linkage
                    driven by a motor that combines the pitch motion of the upper and lower portion of the legs. This
                    choice kept the complexity of the system to two motors and did not add more weight at the end of the
                    foot that the servo needed to support. It also improved the aesthetic of the robot by providing us
                    with a convincing motion of a turtle leg without the need to program it and no extra bulky motors to
                    cover up.</p>


                <p>We chose to implement a Klann linkage which has 5 connections and 3 anchor points. Using the relative
                    dimensions from the example on Wikipedia, we tinkered a little bit with lengths of the linkages and
                    created an initial test prototype. Attaching it to a motor with a support we designed, it worked as intended:</p>
                
                <figure class="fig">
                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cRFd-gyLX1E" frameborder="0"

                    <figcaption>Linkages to get desired motion.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    The rightmost anchor is connected to the motor shaft
                    which rotates a driving linkage. The other anchor points restrain the longest linkage to follow a
                    path which brings the leg up, forwards, puts it down, and draws it underneath the body. With a test
                    linkage working, we scaled it down to fit our turtle and laser cut all of the linkages. Early on,
                    some linkages started to break, and we decided that a better material would be Delrin, as it was two
                    times stronger flexurally. Until we could acquire Delrin, the joints on each linkage were reinforced
                    by making them thicker.</p>

                <figure class="fig">
                    <img src="images/mech/s3/sprint_3_linkage.JPG"/>
                    <figcaption>
                        Caption: A mixture of delrin and hardboard was used for the linkages as we refined the design of
                        the linkage
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>


                <p>The linkage took care of two of the three degrees of freedom. The yaw motion was provided by a servo
                    attached by a bell crank, a glorified 4-bar linkage, to the leg. As the servo rotates, the crank
                    translates its rotation into a sweep of the motor at a wider angle. In this way, we have precise
                    control of the angular position of the foot linkage.</p>

                    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNuBAAkjFvI </p>


                <p>Due to the predicted heavy use of this movement, we were worried about friction between the motor
                    bottom and the plate. We attempted to reducx
                    xxe friction by embedding a marble in the motor support
                    bottom which would in theory rotate more freely on the hardboard. As we saw later, the friction
                    between these parts was not as big of a problem as the vertical movement of the robot with respect
                    to the plate.</p>

                Caption: Under the red motor support, you can see a part of the marble popping out
                <p>The whole sprint was dedicated to pushing for a fully designed turtle to be able to test out every
                    part and iterate if necessary in the next sprint. We started with creating a compartment to house
                    the electronics. This bay would be separated from the plant by a plate which could be easily removed
                    to access the electronics. Because the turtle is carrying a plant that has water that can
                    potentially leak, all of our electrical components also needed to be well-isolated. We decided to
                    attach the dome and the plant to the plate and design to be able to remove this entire system to
                    access the electronics bay.</p>

                Caption: Final CAD


                <p>The electronics bay consists of a wall that follows the perimeter of the turtle base plate and screws
                    into its bottom. It’s height was dictated at first by the height of the Arduino and the motor
                    shield. When we integrated the klann linkage, it became apparent that the shell needed to be high
                    enough to allow the topmost part of the leg to pass through without interference when the turtle is
                    lifting its leg. Because the leg was aso rotating, cutouts were swept out in the shell to allow for
                    full range of motion. The width was dictated by the length of the motors, which were unfortunately
                    very wide and large. Although we were able to find motors that took up less space, the estimated
                    cutout in CAD was not much smaller, and we stayed with our original motors. Cutouts for future
                    wiring to the head and tail were also made.</p>

                Caption: Electronics Bay
                <p>Two of the IR sensors were also to be mounted in the shell. We wanted to preserve the aesthetic of
                    the turtle, so the sensors would need to be embedded. This was an extremely difficult task because
                    the shell is quite thick with limited space, and the sensors needed to be pointing at an angle to
                    the horizontal to be useful in obstacle avoidance. It was also unclear how precise we would be able
                    to mount them so that there would be no interference from the shell and the moving leg. For this
                    reason, we ultimately decided to mount them underneath the base plate, at the head.</p>

                Caption: Head
                <p>The removeable plate went through two of its three iterations. At first, it was designed to slide
                    laterally into the top of the electronics bay. However, upon consideration of the fabrication
                    process, we could not easily cut the piece we needed. Instead of sliding, the plate would lift up
                    and down off of the electronics bay shell. The first method of attachment of the plate to the shell
                    were screws, but these take a lot of time to take out and put back in, and there was very little
                    space on the shell to place them. Our next idea was to use magnets to keep the plate in place as the
                    turtle wobble around. We used a combination of tiny sliding plates and glued parts to secure and
                    prevent the magnets from escaping their places. We very quickly learned that the sliding plates were
                    too small and precise for a 3D printer and were not worth our time. Gluing the magnets was not
                    preferred because we could not easily change the configuration. For the sprint 3 deliverable, we
                    used tape to secure the magnets. Although they seemed an elegant solution, we scrapped the magnets
                    in favor of a simpler and more reliable attachment in the next sprint.</p>

                Caption: Slide Plate, A magnet was taped into a pocket in both the slide plate and the electronics bay
                shell
                <p>We upgraded the caster wheels supporting the turtle to omnidirectional ones to allow for a larger
                    range of motion. We only implemented linear movement, front and back, in Sprint 2 and therefore did
                    not need the supporting wheels to rotate. Sprint 3 would integrate obstacle avoidance which requires
                    the turtle to change its trajectory, making omnidirectional wheels a nice addition.</p>


                <p>Because the electronics bay shell was complicated and required a lot of support material, we had only
                    a part of it to work with when assembling the turtle. We also printed small foot attachments for the
                    ends of the legs to make contact with the ground. The first test resulted in no movement from the
                    turtle. The foot attachments were not making good contact with the ground, but even when we wrapped
                    them in rubber tape, the turtle still would not move. We realized that instead of pulling the leg
                    inwards and pushing the whole body forwards, the turtle was pushing the motor upwards, without
                    affecting the body. There was a very loose vertical constraint on the motor, and with nothing to
                    counteract the force of the foot’s push, the motor popped up and down. The marble that we had put in
                    to lessen friction between the motor mount and the base plate was falling out and proving
                    useless.</p>

                Caption: Foot


                <p>Initial solutions to the problem were to speed up the motor, clamp the shell and plate to the base
                    plate, and to stick cardboard pieces between the motor and the shell to create a tighter vertical
                    constraint on the motor. We also put more weight on the front of the robot to increase the friction
                    on the foot. We also attached a foot made out of layers of hardboard to lengthen the linkage and to
                    increase the contact area with the ground. These changes helped the turtle translate more of the
                    push into lateral motion, but not enough to reliably prope it forwards, as seen in this video:
                    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap4fOlc7e6o&feature=youtu.be </p>

                <p>Instead of testing on a smooth surface, we tried the turtle on the rough side of some hardboard. This
                    made an immense difference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGmxkizyCns After some time, however,
                    the movement became less reliable again. Many causes were identified for the problem, including the
                    legs being sloppy and not well constrained, not enough weight being applied to the legs because the
                    caster wheels were supporting it, covering the feet in material with a higher coefficient of
                    friction, and fortifying the linkages by doubling them.</p>

            <p>This sprint was broken into pieces by Thanksgiving break. During the first part, we integrated the
                movement
                code from the previous sprint with the decision algorithm, as well as wrote code to allow for easy
                testing
                of sensors. After the break was done, we made a quick pivot from a purely Arduino based system to
                communication between a Raspberry Pi and the Arduino. This was in order to facilitate future

                that
                looks for shade to rest in, but these were not tied to actual sensors.</p>

            <p>We purchased additional sensors and calibrated them for plant care!</p>

            <p>The photoresistors were calibrated as a new way to sense light that would use less space on the
                breadboard. This allowed for us to measure light from taking the voltage between the photoresistor
                and a 330 Ohm resistor. </p>

            <p>We added and calibrated a soil moisture sensor by putting it in different wet paper towels. Luckily
                this gave us a good range of data points so no amplification was necessary.</p>

            <p>We added and calibrated a temperature and humidity sensor. For the sake of this project being indoors
                the humidity sensor is not nearly as important when compared to the temperature because we do not
                plan for it to rain inside. The temperature sensor will make sure the plants do not overheat from
                the sunlight. If it is too hot, the turtle can move into the shade until it cools down. Calibrating
                this sensor was difficult because there is one output pin for both pieces of data. After a bunch of
                research we found an example code for this sensor and this worked to properly display our sensor
                values.</p>

                <p>The last few weeks were dedicated to finishing small parts of the design, making the linkage
                    reliable, and fabricating the turtle.</p>


                <p>A head and a tail were designed to easily attach to the base plate and house the light sensors, LEDs,
                    and IR sensors. We printed test parts to make sure that the sensors would fit into the holes and did
                    not have interference from the walls in which they would be embedded. To make powering the turtle on
                    and off easier, we embedded an easily accessible switch in the tail.</p>


                <p>To finish the design, a mold for the dome was created. We wanted a transparent, ellipsoidal shell for
                    the turtle to be able to see the plant from the outside and to look nice with the elliptical shape
                    of the base plate. We manufactured the dome by vacuum forming plastic over a mold made out of
                    machinable foam. The first pass failed because our sheet of acrylic was too small. The second dome
                    turned out well for testing purposes, but was too foggy due to inadequate filing of the dome. The
                    next iteration will be made on a smoother dome for better transparency.</p>

                (A mold was made out of machinable foam over which a sheet of PETG plastic was vacuum formed).


                <p>We wanted to be able to access the plant to take care of it, and therefore the dome must be
                    removeable. Initially, the whole dome was to pop off, but keeping the water and dirt off of the
                    electronics was of higher priority, and we decided that a hatch could be created in the dome for
                    partial access instead. Using rebar wire, a hinge will be created to easily flip it up and down.
                    In the interest of further protecting the electronics from water, we designed an inner ring that
                    would attach to the plate and contain the soil and the plant. Instead of attempting to attach a thin
                    dome to the base plate, its sides would be screwed to the inner ring and seal the barrier between
                    the plant and the rest of the turtle. The inner ring also allowed us to adjust the height at which
                    the dome would be sitting to not interfere with the plants.</p>


                <p>The plate separating the electronics bay from the dome was simplified further during this sprint.
                    Instead of using magnets, the plate has press-fit dowels which will fit into slightly larger holes
                    on the shell and secure the plate in the lateral plane. Because of the weight of the plant and dome,
                    vertical movement will not be very significant and therefore does not need to be restrained. To
                    remove the dome and plant, it simply needs to be lifted. This modification also allowed us to laser
                    cut the plate out of hardboard and match it with the base plate for a better look.</p>

                Caption: CAD of the shell


                <p>To put more weight onto the front of the turtle, the front caster wheel was made smaller to make the
                    robot lean forwards. Furthermore, in order to reduce the tolerances in the linkages, which was the
                    cause of failure in the turtle’s gait, we introduced journal bearings and dowel pins to connect the
                    linkages rather than using poorly fitted #4 nuts and bolts. After these changes were implemented, it
                    became apparent that for the turtle to walk, the legs must be completely out of phase with each
                    other. Without any regulation, they slowly fall into phase and let the turtle drop onto its nose. By
                    adding push buttons on the tips of the feet, we were able to keep track of when each leg was on the
                    ground and use the Arduino to regulate the motion. Although we had planned to have four legs moving,
                    we have decided to focus on the look and character of the turtle instead for the remaining week. We
                    designed the turtle with possibility for later modifications in mind, a decision which allows us to
                    confidently put the back two legs on the back burner.</p>

                <p>To make the robot look like a turtle, the electronics bay is being covered in epoxy, fiberglass, and
                    a gradient wash of green and brown paint. We are experimenting with a stretchy fabric covering for
                    the legs to mimic the skin of a turtle. The leg will have a tight fitting stocking of fabric fitted
                    over it and pulled tight to all corners of the shell attached by strong velcro. This design will
                    allow us to cover the unused holes from the back legs, access the linkages if necessary, and to play
                    around with the look of the fabric.</p>
